Pattern Memory (Experience)

This file stores learned patterns from work on TrendyToys.

Examples:
- recurring bugs
- common failure modes
- architectural sensitivities
- human habits that cause regressions

This is experiential memory, not blame.

Update when the same mistake appears twice and can be described clearly.

When to write a pattern:
- wait until a bug, failure mode, or misunderstanding has recurred
- describe the pattern in terms of causes and signals, not a single incident
- link to relevant history, decisions, or sessions where it appeared
- add any simple checks or habits that prevent it from repeating

Current status:
- no project-specific patterns recorded yet
- first patterns should be added once real code and workflows exist
