System Synthesis — Living Mental Model

This file represents TAQWIN’s current understanding of the TrendyToys project as a whole.

Update this only when understanding materially improves based on what is actually present
in the repository and what is recorded in .taqwin/.

Include when known:
- what the system is
- what it is not
- core architecture ideas
- known fragilities
- strategic direction

This is not a log.
This is a snapshot of comprehension at the time of last update.

Current status:
- The TrendyToys project is a UI-first demo e-commerce website for toys.
- The core specification is:
  - docs/prd.md — product scope, flows, architecture, and completion criteria
  - .taqwin/design-tokens.md — canonical visual tokens
  - .taqwin/ui-inventory.md — canonical component families and variants
- Together, these three files define the demo system at the product and design level.
- No real backend, payments, or logistics systems are present yet; all flows are demo-only.

Evidence and uncertainty:
- record only what can be traced to concrete files, code, or human instructions (e.g., docs/prd.md)
- note the source and confidence level for each major understanding
- if evidence is thin, state the uncertainty instead of extrapolating
